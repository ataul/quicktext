There are many snippets available and more are added randomly. This page will provide some guideline about these snippets.


It is quite hard to make snippets consistent.

HTML
Tag name can be used to get openning and closing tags. Often additional attributes and/or nested tags are added.

PHP
Each CMS or Framework has their own prefix. These prefix are added to get the corresponding code of specific code block. For example we want to run query for Joomla. Joomla has prefix "j" and for query we run "q". Thus if we use snippet "jq" it will generate code required for query in Joomla. Similar task can be achieved in Drupal using "dq".

CMS                   Prefix
----                  -------
Joomla                j
Drupal                d
Magneto               mag
Symfony               sf
Pligg                 p

Javascript
