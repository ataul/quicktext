#ctrl+enter does not work in notepad++
(NEW VERSION NOW USES TAB INSTEAD OF CTRL+ENTER)
It's because of the use of that shortcut(ctrl+enter) by "Word completion"

# Detail #

Settings > Shortcut Mapper
"Main menu" has "Word completion" with shortcut key "Ctrl+Enter"
And "Plugin commands" has an entry as "Replace Tag".

Changing either of the two shortcuts to a different key
combination will solve the problem.
